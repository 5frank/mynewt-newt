# Contributing 

## Introduction

Anybody who works with Apache Mynewt can be a contributing member of the 
community that develops and deploys it.  The process of releasing an operating 
system for microcontrollers is never done: and we welcome your contributions
to that effort.

## Pull Requests

Apache Mynewt welcomes pull request via Github.  Discussions are done on Github,
but depending on the topic, can also be relayed to the official Apache Mynewt
developer mailing list dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org.

If you are suggesting a new feature, please email the developer list directly,
with a description of the feature you are planning to work on.  

We do not merge pull requests directly on Github, all PRs will be pulled and 
pushed through http://git.apache.org/.

## Filing Bugs

Bugs can be filed on the 
[Apache Mynewt Bug Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYNEWT).

Where possible, please include a self-contained reproduction case!

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should also be filed on the 
[Apache Mynewt Bug Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYNEWT).  
Please introduce it as a ticket type "Wish." 

## Writing Tests

We love getting newt tests!  Apache Mynewt is a huge undertaking, and improving
code coverage is a win for every Apache Mynewt user.  

## Writing Documentation

Contributing to documentation (in addition to writing tests), is a great way 
to get involved with the Apache Mynewt project.

Pull requests to the apache-mynewt-site repository on Github are the best 
way to submit documentation.  For more information on contributing to the 
documentation, the [FAQ](http://mynewt.apache.org/faq/answers/) has some 
more information.

If you are having trouble contributing to Apache Mynewt, or just want to talk 
to a human about what you're working on, you can contact us via the 
[developers mailing list](mailto:dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org).
