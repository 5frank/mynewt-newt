# Newt

Newt is a build and package management tool for embedded projects. Newt makes
it easy to create reusable components, and provides a framework for building
them for multiple different architectures. For more information on Newt, please
go to: http://mynewt.apache.org/

Note: The newt tool depends on the yaml.v2 Go package
(https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2).  This package is licensed under the LGPLv3, which
is incompatible with the Apache 2.0 license.  This incompatibility will be
resolved in a future beta release of the newt tool.
