[Issue Tracker Summary](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319221&version=12334805)

This is the first source release of the "New" Newt.  More information on the 
genesis of Newt, and a description can be found 
[here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-mynewt-dev/201603.mbox/%3C56E21C13.9050303%40apache.org%3E)

As an early beta release of Newt, all the normal caveats apply:

  * APIs and commands may change without warning

  * There are definitely bugs hiding around many corners

However, the belief is that this version of Newt represents the going forward 
architecture of the Newt tool in Apache Mynewt.  So people who are interested 
in playing around and using Newt, are encouraged to download and begin to 
evaluate it.

Future versions will add: 

  * More robust package management and versioning

  * Plenty of helper commands for seeing what's installed, what's changed, 
    and why things failed.

The next release of the Newt tool is planned for April 15th, 2016.  If working on 
next-generation build and source package management systems sounds exciting to you,
get in touch, by sending a mail to the Apache Mynewt Developer's list, dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org.
